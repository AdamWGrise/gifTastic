/* To do:
    Need to have a library of buttons up top populating based on an input and submit (array of animals, loop through to make buttons)
    The buttons need to pull a group of gifs from the giphy api (maybe just go with 3; no reason to go with 10). The gifs need to be clickable, so they start as a freeze image and "play" when clicked, then "pause" again when clicking another time.
    Look at giphy parameters(?): q, limit, rating
    Giphy api key for me: xyrnqWXfU1VtQMLv35efwBKSnFDbth66
    Use the HTTPS protocol in the query URL, as that's the best way to guarantee it'll work reliably in Github Pages.
